This exercise deals with constructing classes for complex vectors over the field of complex numbers. We are required to build appropriate constructors based on the exercise instructions. Additionally, we need to create class functions and decide on suitable fields.

Files we've created:
- ArrayStructure.h: Definition of the dynamic allocation class for vector operations.
- ArrayStructure.cpp: Implementation of constructors and functions for dynamic allocation, including delete, copy, and assignment operations.
- Vector.h: Definition of the Vector class containing a dynamic array.
- Vector.cpp: Implementation of constructors and functions for the Vector class.
- Zi.h: Definition of the class for complex numbers and relevant operators.
- Zi.cpp: Implementation of operators and constructors for the Zi class.

Key Data Structures:
- A dynamically allocated array that contains objects of type Zi.
